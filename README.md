# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub!

Hi all, my name is Tenzin Sherab and I am a Chemical Engineering Student with a passion for technology. I am trying to broaden my horizons by trying to improve my programming skills. My GitHub account will serve as a beacon of learning for me while also holstering the projects I intend to create. Happy coding!
